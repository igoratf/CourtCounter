# CourtCounter
Android app based on CourtCounter project from Udacity's Android Course. I've been inspired by the project, but the code has been written by looking only at the design proposed. Except for margin and fontsize, everything was written without following the instructions, what may cause some differences between the course's code and mine. Edit: the main ViewGroup was also inspired in the course.

Court Counter's objective is to match a basketball score for 2 teams, based on the different types of punctuation, such as free throws, 2 points basket and 3 points basket.
There is also a reset button to zero the scores for whenever the game is over.
