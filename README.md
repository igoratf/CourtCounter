# CourtCounter
Android app based on CourtCounter project from Udacity's Android Course. Simple code written based on the design proposed by the course.

Court Counter's objective is to match a basketball score for 2 teams, based on the different types of punctuation, such as free throws, 2 points basket and 3 points basket.
There is also a reset button to zero the scores for whenever the game is over.
